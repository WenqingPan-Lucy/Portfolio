                        Our project is rooted in the desire to bring new life to Changjia Manor, a historic estate in
                        Taiyuan that, despite its rich cultural heritage, has seen a decline in visitor numbers and
                        public attention. The manor, with its centuries-old history, deserves to be appreciated and
                        remembered, yet it remains largely overlooked by modern audiences.

                        In response to this challenge, we have combined the innovative potential of Augmented Reality
                        (AR) technology with narrative-driven gameplay to create an immersive experience designed to
                        engage visitors and deepen their understanding of the manorâ€™s significance. By integrating AR
                        with storytelling, we have crafted a game that encourages players to explore the estate,
                        triggering interactive narratives at specific locations. These narrative moments uncover the
                        stories and historical context behind the manor, bringing its past to life in a way that is both
                        educational and entertaining.

                </h1>
                <p>
                    To begin our project, we first visited Taiyuan and explored Changjia Manor, immersing ourselves in
                    the local culture and history. This initial research phase allowed us to gain a deeper understanding
                    of the region's heritage and the significance of the manor. By engaging with the community and the
                    environment, we identified key cultural landmarks and unique features of the estate that could serve
                    as interactive anchor points for our narrative-driven game.

                    <p>
                        We conducted on-site model data collection using tools such as the "3D Scanner APP" to capture
                        3D image data of key structures and features within Changjia Manor. This process allowed us to
                        create accurate digital representations of important areas within the manor, preserving their
                        details for integration into our augmented reality experience.

                        other relevant sources, we were able to uncover key events, figures, and cultural elements that
                        have shaped the manor's legacy over the centuries. </p>

                        We crafted a compelling storyline rooted in mystery to guide players through an immersive

                        together the manorâ€™s rich history. As players progress through the game, they encounter various
                        cultural landmarks and artifacts, each revealing a fragment of the story and shedding light on
                        the heritage of the Chang Family Manor. This approach not only engages players in an exciting

                        the site.

                    <p> We utilized Unity and Blender to refine the collected 3D data and develop a functional game

                        primary platform for creating the game, enabling us to build an interactive and immersive demo
